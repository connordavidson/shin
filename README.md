Shin is a travel app that integrates everyday GPS navigation with air travel, public transit, rideshare, and hospitality. 

Shin users earn points for using GPS navigation which can be redeemed in-app for air travel, public transit, rideshare, and hospitality. 

This all-in-one travel integration provides an industry-leading experience for users and fills a gap that other navigation apps miss: helping users nagivate through every life experiences seamlessly


NOTES, GOALS, & THOUGHTS: 

* is a navigation app that has more detail than regular app  (eg waze but better)
    * Should be have a comprehensive walkability/walking mode.
    * Should be able to submit locations of sketchy activities, areas to avoid, etc which will empower people who are walking home at night to feel safe (*women will love this*) 
    * Should be able to integrate aforementioned submissions to reroute people (and articulate why they’re being rerouted) based on feedback from other users
    * feature where you can send an alert to a friend/loved one if you feel unsafe (*women will love this*) 
* should include buying tickets for planes/trains/busses etc and highly detailed integrations (automatically offer to navigate to flights, automatically suggest telling people where their gates and/or lounges are based on airline&status) 
    * Can integrate users’ frequent flyer numbers so they can still get miles 
    * Can call an uber 
    * GOAL UX FLOW: User has a flight.
      1) They receive a notification suggesting to leave soon for their flight, click on it, and open our app to navigate to the airport. 
      2) We display their frequent-flyer/flight info as a live activity so they can easily check-in their bags. 
      3) After check-in, we show their gate number with options to route to the gate. 
      4) When flight boarding time is near, we show their seat number.
      5) When they land, we tell them what baggage claim they’re in.
      6 option a) While they’re waiting, we prompt them to approve us automatically calling an Uber (based on their preconfigured default uber class of black, XL, etc) to their hotel/airbnb.
      6 option b) We automatically display rental car info.
      7) On the way to the hotel, we display the necessary info for them to check in. 
* ***users earn in-app points for every route they take and can redeem these points within app for $$. this gamification is how we get new users and break Google/Apple Maps dominance***	
    * These points can be redeemed at a low rate for airlines and hotels. If users earn points every time they use their GPS, they will rack up a ton of points in a short period of time and will love our app. 
    * The gamification will allow us to get more user data than otherwise because user’s will be incentivized to use the app **even when they don’t need to navigate**. This will give us an insane amount of data that a regular navigation app would not have
    * point bonus for streaks 
    * point bonus for riding/walking/train-ing a route you usually drive 
    * point bonus for recommending to others
